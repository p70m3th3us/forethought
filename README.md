minecraft 1.18 ease of use closet hack/ghost mod (fabric)

### features:
- none
### planned additions:
- autotool
- autoclicker (for afk farms)
- better xray
- autototem
- autoarmor
- autoeat (to turn on when autoclicker is on)
- auto sort inventory
- minimap (most likely suggest xaeros minimap)
- player near indicator
- all players receive glow effect
- over lava indicator
- auto mlg
- baritone but harder to detect (not likely)
- antifall (prevents player from walking off an edge, does not place blocks or lag back)
- hostile mob indicator
- low durability chat message
- show invisible players (and indicate which players are invisible)
- freelook
- see other players health
- see parts of other players inventory
- chest/shulker steal (take items from storage quickly at the press of a button, not automatically)

the goal is to have as many things as possible be automatic, so few things have to be turned on or off. the things that shouldn't be automatic are meant to be made as easy to use as possible. ui should be as clean as possible, unlike normal hacked clients. nothing should be detectable by the server.
